# Flask CRUD API for Data Management

This Flask-based API project provides Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) functionality for data stored in a MySQL database. You can use this API as a foundation for various data management tasks, making it suitable for a wide range of applications.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- Python 3.x
- Flask
- pymysql
- json (usually comes with Python)
- Other required libraries (install using `pip install`)

## Setting up the Development Environment

1. Clone this repository to your local machine
2. Create a virtual environment:
 ```
python -m venv venv
```  
3. Activate your virtual environment :
   
- On Windows:
``
venv\Scripts\activate
``
- On macOS and Linux:
``
source venv/bin/activate
``
3. Install required libraries:
```
pip install Flask pymysql
```

## Configuration
In both `db.py` and `app.py`, you'll need to configure the database connection details. Open these files and fill in the following information:
```python
# db.py
import pymysql

conn = pymysql.connect(
    host="your_mysql_host",
    user="your_mysql_username",
    password="your_mysql_password",
    database="your_database_name",
    charset='utf8mb4',
    cursorclass=pymysql.cursors.DictCursor
)

```
```python
# app.py
from flask import Flask , request , jsonify
import json
import pymysql


app = Flask(__name__)


# Database connection configuration
def db_connection():
    conn = None
    try:
        conn = pymysql.connect(host="your_mysql_host",
    			       	user="your_mysql_username",
                               	password="your_mysql_password",
                               	database="your_database_name",
                               	charset='utf8mb4',
                                cursorclass=pymysql.cursors.DictCursor)
    except pymysql.error as e :
        print(e)
    return conn

# Other API code...

```
## Running the API
To run the API, execute the following command:
```
python app.py
```
The API will be accessible at `http://localhost:5000`.

## API Endpoints
- **GET /items:** Retrieve all items.
- **GET /items/{id}:** Retrieve an item by its ID.
- **POST /items:** Create a new item.
- **PUT /items/{id}:** Update an item by its ID.
- **DELETE /items/{id}:** Delete an item by its ID.
  
## Example Data: "Autos"
In this project, we've used a sample database named "autos" as an illustrative example. This dataset includes the following fields:
- **`id_autos:`** An auto's unique identifier.
- **`id_parking:`** An identifier representing the parking location.
- **`matricule:`** The vehicle's registration number.
 Please note that you can customize the database schema to suit your specific requirements. The provided example serves as a starting point for understanding the CRUD operations implemented in this Flask API. To adapt this project to your needs, you can modify the database name and schema in the `db.py` file .
